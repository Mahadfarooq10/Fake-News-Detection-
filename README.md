# Fake-News-Detection-

The project accomplishes these tasks :

Text cleaning and preprocessing of fake_or_real_news dataset using NLTK and Regex library.

Creating and transforming clean text into tf-idf vectors.

Learning models like Passive Aggressive Classifier, XGBoost and LGBM to perform classification of fake and real news pieces. (A few other algorithms were also tried but only the best performers are chosen here.)

Evaluate each model's performance based on the accuracy scores and confusion matrices they produced.
